# Computer Systems Projects Repository

This repository contains my projects for the Computer Systems course. The projects cover various topics, including digital circuit design using Logisim and assembly language programming.

## Project 1: Digital Circuit Design using Logisim

In this project, I designed and implemented digital circuits using Logisim. The circuits include combinational and sequential logic circuits, such as adders, multiplexers, flip-flops, and counters.

## Project 2: Assembly Language Programming

The second project involved writing programs in assembly language for a specific architecture. I learned how to use assembly instructions to perform tasks such as arithmetic operations, memory manipulation, and control flow.

## K MAP and SOP

This directory contains details implementation of K MAP , SOP , POS concepts along with Practical explanations.

Feel free to explore the individual project folders for more details, source code, and documentation.
